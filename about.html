                Hi, my name is <strong>Pamilerin Marvelous Adegbite</strong>. I am a dedicated Software Engineering student at Miva Open University and a participant in the Power Learn Project (PLP), where I am actively learning web development, Python, SQL, and startup skills. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy combining my growing technical knowledge with creativity to build simple and functional web applications. Alongside my studies, I am also learning data engineering and exploring how data, programming, and problem-solving connect to create real solutions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My goal is to become a professional software engineer with strong skills in backend development, data engineering, and full-stack web applications. I am passionate about continuous learning, discipline, and building projects that can make a positive impact.
